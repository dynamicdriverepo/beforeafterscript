  "description": "This script lets you easily view an \"after\" version of any image as an overlay of the original one. It makes for a dramatic way of comparing two images and any subtle differences. A draggable handle bar lets the user decide how much of each image he/she wishes to view. The \"before\" and \"after\" slides can each contain not just a main image, but other HTML as well, such as a caption. Furthermore, the script can load another set of images on demand.",
